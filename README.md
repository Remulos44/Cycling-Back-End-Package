# Cycling Back-End Package
This is my ecm1410: Object-Oriented Programming coursework, where we were tasked with developing a back-end Java package to fulfil the pre-determined system functionality, with a provided interface.
Our back-end package allows the creating of a staged cycling race similar to the cycling Grand Tours, such as the Tour de France.
